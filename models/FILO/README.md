# FILO
Accorsi, Luca, and Daniele Vigo. "A fast and scalable heuristic for the solution of large-scale 
capacitated vehicle routing problems." Transportation Science 55.4 (2021): 832-856.

The implementation of FILO in the RA is based on the publication: 
_Accorsi, Luca, and Daniele Vigo. "A fast and scalable heuristic for the solution of large-scale 
capacitated vehicle routing problems." Transportation Science 55.4 (2021): 832-856._
 The implementation and README in the directory (RA/models/FILO/lib) is taken 
from the original source code on https://github.com/acco93/filo. The FILO implementation
is based on the COBRA algorithm implementation available here: https://github.com/acco93/cobra.
