The implementation of DACT (VRP-DACT) in the RA is based on the publication: 
_Ma, Yining, et al. "Learning to iteratively solve routing problems with dual-aspect collaborative transformer." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 11096-11107._

The code in the directory (RA/models/DACT/DACT) is taken and partly adapted from the original code provided on
https://github.com/yining043/VRP-DACT. 
The main changes were made to retrieve solution trajectories and amend the input structure for training.
We have noted these changes in the corresponding files with a comment at the beginning of the file.
