The savings implementation in the RA is based on the work in: 
_J. Rasku, T. Kärkkäinen, and N. Musliu. Meta-survey and implementations of 
classical capacitated vehicle routing heuristics with reproduced results. 
Toward Automatic Customization of Vehicle Routing Systems (pp. 133-260).

The implementation uses the open-source software in: https://github.com/yorak/VeRyPy 
which can be installed via: `pip install https://github.com/yorak/VeRyPy/zipball/master`.
