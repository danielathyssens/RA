# HGS
Vidal, Thibaut. "Hybrid genetic search for the CVRP: Open-source implementation and SWAP* 
neighborhood." Computers & Operations Research 140 (2022): 105643.

The implementation of HGS in the RA is based on the publication: 
_Vidal, Thibaut. "Hybrid genetic search for the CVRP: Open-source implementation and SWAP* 
neighborhood." Computers & Operations Research 140 (2022): 105643._
 The implementation and README in the directory (RA/models/HGS/HGS) is taken 
from the original source code on https://github.com/vidalt/HGS-CVRP.  Note that before running
HGS, the implementation needs to be compiled. The straightforward instructions are available in 
the author's original [README.md](RA/models/HGS/HGS/README.md).
