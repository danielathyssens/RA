The implementation of POMO in the RA is based on the publication: 
_Choo, Jinho, et al. "Simulation-guided beam search for neural combinatorial 
optimization." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 8760-8772._
 
The implementation and README in the directory (RA/models/SGBS/SGBS) are taken 
from the original source code on https://github.com/yd-kwon/SGBS. 
Changes in the original source code have been noted in the corresponding code files 
with a comment at the beginning of the file.
