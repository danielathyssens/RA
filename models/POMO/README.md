Kwon, Yeong-Dae, et al. "Pomo: Policy optimization with multiple optima 
for reinforcement learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing 
Systems 33 (2020): 21188-21198.

The implementation of POMO in the RA is based on the publication: 
_Kwon, Yeong-Dae, et al. "Pomo: Policy optimization with multiple optima for 
reinforcement learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 
33 (2020): 21188-21198._
 
The implementation and README in the directory (RA/models/POMO/POMO) are taken 
from the original source code on https://github.com/yd-kwon/POMO/tree/master/NEW_py_ver. 
Changes in the original source code have been noted in the corresponding code files 
with a comment at the beginning of the file.
